This is my assessment for the Junior Software Engineer position. 

This is as far as I got with my time, however I have noted some of the next steps I would take if I had more.

I used [JSCharting](https://jscharting.com/) to create the graph for each state.


**next steps**

  With more time I would like to:

> Change the state selection buttons to a chloropleth map like [this one](https://jscharting.com/examples/chart-types/geographic-map/us-counties-dynamic/). oloured according to which party won and by how much.

> Clickable states that lead to the current information display.

> When hovering over a state it will show the graph.
